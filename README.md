# TypingGame

This is a simple typing. It includes a timer which starts from 5 seconds and if the correct word is not fully typed and timer reaches 0, the game is over. The timer resets when the correct word is typed and a new words appears, this goes on until the user is unable to type the word within the type specified.

To make sure the game runs in the intended manner, please make sure to download the game on your local device keeping the file structure in exactly the same manner as you see on my github page. 

To run the game double click on the html file.
